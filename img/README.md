In this directory are the image samples.

Each image sample shows 4 images and then a 5th image which matches one of the 4 other images.

The objective is to figure out which of the 4 images matches the 5th image.
There are some precursor steps like partitioning the 4 images into 4 separate images for comparison with the 1 image.
